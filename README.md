## A patch with automated timers for accurate timing of song speedruns.

# Timing rules
- Start position: When screen fades in </br>
- Finish position: Immidiately after all conditions required for playing the music are met </br>

# Details
- Patch should support every version of BO2, no Plutonium exclusive features are being used </br>
- Patch supports all Easter Egg songs in BO2 </br>
- Patch does not change any game rules besides setting Strafe & Backspeed to proper values (which is being done by both Redacted and Plutonium anyways) </br>
- Patch contains some extra functions that are disabled for release version as they could be considered cheating, they can however be used for practice, feel free to complile the patch yourself with variable `level.TESTING` set to `true`, but don't forget to put back the original version before going for the record run </br>
- If you want to report a problem or request a feature, you may use the Issues section. </br>
