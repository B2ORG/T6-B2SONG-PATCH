# Timing rules

# Details
- Patch should support every version of BO2, no Plutonium exclusive features are being used </br>
- Patch supports all Easter Egg songs in BO2 </br>
- Patch does not change any game rules besides setting Strafe & Backspeed to proper values (which is being done by both Redacted and Plutonium anyways) </br>
- If you want to report a problem or request a feature, you may use the Issues section. </br>

## Changelog
# V3
- Seconds decimals (ms) have been reduced to one, due to 2nd decimal being inaccurate at times. Eg: `.8 == 800ms`</br>
